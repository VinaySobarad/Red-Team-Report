# Red-Team-Report
Here's the red team report, where I had sent a phishing email to the target, and from then I have explained in detail, how the payload is generated, and how it bypasses the windows defender, and how we get a shell. If you want to follow it properly, then please check the pdf file uploaded here.

Thank You
